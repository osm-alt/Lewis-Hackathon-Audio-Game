# Lewis-Hackathon-Audio-Game

This is a game developed for the Hackathon by Lewis Menelaws with the theme "Functionally Dysfunctional".

The code take a .wav audio file and generates a plot of the sound waves of that audio.
It then uses that plot as a background image where the user has to avoid the blue blobs of the sound waves to keep the audio running.
